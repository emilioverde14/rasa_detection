      is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the virus called SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the coronavirus family. The first cases were found in China.
      As of 9 September 2021, its apparent fatality rate (CFR) is 2.06%. The death rate from infection (IFR, which includes all infected,
       even those who contract COVID but do not take a test in which they are positive, either due to lack of availability or because they are asymptomatic 
       or have mild symptoms) was instead estimated, for the first wave of the pandemic, between 0.5 and 2% depending on the country, with strong 
       differences by age group (from 0.004% for children under 34 to 28.3% for older of 85). The most frequent flu-like symptoms are: fever, cough, headache (headache), 
       dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia and myalgia (pain in joints and muscles), asthenia (tiredness) and gastrointestinal such as diarrhea;
        characteristic symptoms of COVID-19 disease are anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste), which are transient."
